How do I approach designing software? The way I design software is to read carefully over the requirements and use those to guide what I program.
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? I have never done anything with graphics before so everything was new to me. I feel like I learned a ton.
What design process did you follow for your project work? I tried to keep things as simple as possible while following the requirements set for the project.
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? I would focus on the requirements and having an eye for detail.

How do I approach developing programs? This one was fairly easy because it broke everything into elements of what was needed for the requirements, such as the object itself, textures, lighting, and camera movement.
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? I haven't really ever had to continuously had to add new features to the same object before so that was fairly new.
How did iteration factor into your development? I would add a feature, make sure it worked, and then start another feature.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion? The thing that evolved the most in developing this code was creating the initial array because it started with just coordinates and colors and expanded to include texture coordinates and normals. The fragment shader also evolved quite a bit.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? The main way computer science can help me in my goals is by preparing me for a career in software engineering.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? If I have another course or the need to add specific graphics to a project, I know the basics of how to do it now.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway? As for my career, I don't have a specific type of programing that I am leaning toward yet, but if I get into a more visual type, I have a foundation now.
